# SNES Wordle
A homebrew port of [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) to the [SNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System).


This game uses the [PVSneslib](https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib)
suite which is a C compiler and toolchain for developing games on the SNES in a higher level than assembly.
The library is quite finnicky to get set up.
